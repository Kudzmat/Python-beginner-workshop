Let's Make Game Keep Running
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    # create game on variable
    game_on = True

    while game_on:
      pass

Let's create a function that will welcome the player
-----------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    # our constants
    CPU_OPTIONS = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    USER_OPTIONS = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']

    # global variable name
    name = ""

    def game_menu():
      
      # get name
      global name  # we need to call the global variable before using it
      name = input("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors! Please Enter Your Name: ").capitalize()


    while game_on:
        game_menu()
        print(name)
        break


Let's create more options for the player
-------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python
  
    def game_menu():  
        # get name
        global name  # we need to call the global variable before using it
        name = input("Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors! Please Enter Your Name: ").capitalize()
        print()

        menu_selection = input("""
        Welcome {name}, what would you like to do?
        1. Play Game
        2. Exit Game
        """)
    
        return menu_selection  # why do we return and not print?


    while game_on:
        print(game_menu())  # check we are returning something
        break


Defensive programming for using numbers for options
---------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    logged = False
    # options = [1,2]

    while not logged:
        # type casing to make sure we get int
        menu_selection = int(input(f"""

                1. Play Game
                2. Exit Game
                """))

        # many ways to create defence
        if menu_selection < 1 or menu_selection > 2: # if menu_selection not in options
            print("Please select either 1 or 2")
            logged = False
        else:
            logged = True

    return menu_selection


Let's create a function for playing the game
----------------------------------------------


.. code-block:: python

    # let students try this
    def play_game():

        # we want to play multiple rounds
        playing = True

        while playing:
            # type casting

            1. Rock
            2. Paper

            find_winner(user_selection)

        # user_selection as parameter
    def find_winner(user_selection):
        pass

    # let's also add the option to exit the game using exit()
    while game_on:
            menu_selection = game_menu()

            # play game
            if menu_selection == 1:
                pass

            else:

Let's create even better game logic
----------------------------------------------

        for item in CPU_CHOICES:
            print(f"{item.capitalize()}...")
            time.sleep(1)

        # get cpu option
        cpu = random.choice(CPU_CHOICES)

        # show each option
        # since we're using numbers, we can index with a list
        print(f"{name} - {CPU_CHOICES[user_selection - 1]} vs CPU - {cpu}")
        print("-------------------------------------")

        
        # win
        if GAME_RULES[user]['strong'] == cpu:
            return "*** You Win!!! ***", 1
        
        # lose

Game results and score logic
------------------------------

            3. Scisoors"""))

            # save results in a variable (will be a tuple)
            results = find_winner(user_selection)

Replaying game and exiting
