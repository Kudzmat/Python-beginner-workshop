## Introduction

This workshop is intended to be an engaging, full-day, in-person event that introduces participants to the basics of Python programming. The primary goal is to guide participants through building a Rock-Paper-Scissors game by the end of the workshop.

## How to Install

### Downloading Python

Instructions for downloading Python for different operating systems can be found in the [download-python.md](download-python.md) file.

### Downloading a Code Editor

Instructions for downloading a code editor can be found in the [code-editor.md](code-editor.md) file.

## Workshop Overview

### Workshop Goals

- Teach participants the basics of Python programming.
- Build a functional Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
- Encourage interactive learning through theory and practical sessions.
- Reinforce learning with quizzes and small prizes.

### Schedule

The workshop follows a "theory and practical" pattern, alternating between instructional content and hands-on coding exercises. Small quizzes and game periods are interspersed to encourage participation and reinforce learning.

### Requirements

- Participants must bring a laptop.
- The venue will provide internet access.
- Lunch will be provided to participants.
- Small prizes will be given during quiz sections to encourage participation.

## Workshop Content

### How Python Works

Introduction to the Python programming language and its basic principles.

### Data Types

#### Numbers

Understanding and working with numerical data in Python.

#### Built-in Functions

Overview of Python's built-in functions and how to use them.

#### Variables

Introduction to variables and how to store data in Python.

#### Strings

Working with textual data using Python strings.

#### Lists

Using lists to store and manipulate collections of data.

#### Booleans & Operators

Understanding boolean values and using operators in Python.

#### Loops

Using loops to repeat actions and iterate over data.

#### If Statements

Conditional statements and decision-making in Python.

#### Functions

Defining and using functions to organize and reuse code.

#### Dictionaries

Using dictionaries to store and retrieve data using key-value pairs.

### Code-Along Sessions

Participants will follow along with the instructor to write code based on the concepts discussed. The code for these sessions can be found in the `code-along` folder. These sessions are designed to be interactive, with questions and answers encouraged.

### Game Periods

There will be three game periods where participants will work on building and improving their Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Each period will focus on enhancing user experience and refining the code, reinforcing the principles of development and iteration in software development.
